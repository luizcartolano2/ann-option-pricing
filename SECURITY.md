## Incident Response Process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, I will follow the following
process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment

The first step is to find out the root cause, nature and scope of the incident.

### 2. Response

After the initial assessment and containment to my best abilities, I will
document all actions taken in a response plan.

### 3. Remediation

Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, I will summarize the lessons
learned from the incident and create a list of actions I will take to prevent
it from happening again.
